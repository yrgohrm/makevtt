# Make VTT

This is a small script to simplify my current (quite bad) workflow for subtitles.

Using Word I transcribe the audio and make it into a text file. But that
transcription only contains the start time and often have quite long
lines.

This script breaks down long lines and outputs a VTT file that can be imported
into YouTube and used in other applications. It does not use the audio in any
way and thus the broken down lines will not have perfect time codes, but
it is at least decent enough for me.
